# Native Language Identification

Having English essay writen by a non-native individual, my goal is to identify their native language.

I use NLI Shared Task 2013 data, which contains documents in 11 languages. Particularly interesting is the fact that humans are quite bad in this task (human professionals achieve 40-50% accuracy), while machine learning models can achieve high performance (82.55% achieved)
