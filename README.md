# Native Language Identification

Having English essay writen by a non-native individual, my goal is to identify their native language.

I use NLI Shared Task 2013 data, which contains documents in 11 languages. Particularly interesting is the fact that humans are quite bad in this task (human professionals achieve 40-50% accuracy), while machine learning models can achieve high performance (82.55% achieved)

*DEU	P6	medium	IThe importance and popularity of travelling is still raising , Everybody is interested in getting to know other countries and continents but the ways how to do it , are very differently .  I agree with the statement that it is the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide .   If you travel in a group and you have a tour guide you get to know the most famous places and you get to know interesting things about the country you decided to visit .  The tour guide would organise everything for you , so the only thing you would have to do is to go to the appointments with the group .   Another aspect is that you would get to know a lot of interesting people .  When you travel in a group it is very easy to get to know other people because usually you sit in the same bus or you sleep in the same hotel like the others do .  That is why you are never borring when you travel in groups .   If you decide to travel in a group and you visit a country which is dangerouses then the tour guide can inform you about this dangerouses and he can say you how to avoid risks .  Sometimes there are special rules or other things which can bring you in trouble when you do not follow them .   Furthermore a tour guide can help you with communication problems .  When you are not able to speak the language people in the country you visit speak , then the tour guide can help you because he has to be able to speak it .  So if you have to visit the doctor or you have to go to the police because something happended to you , then you can ask your tour guide and he would be able to help you .   These are the reasons why I prefer to tavel in a group with a tour guide .

TUR	P1	high	It is an important decision , how to plan your syllabus .  Some students prefer to take a lot of courses and expand their knowledge , whereas some other prefer to specialize in one specific subject .  In this essay I will dwell on the advantages of specializing in one subject and argue in its favor .   There are at least three reasons why choosing one subject is better than trying to keep balance between many subjects .  The first and most important reason for me is that this way people concentrate on one thing and do not feel anxiety about time-management and deadlines .  In contrast , student who take three or four subjects are very busy and stressed , because they have to prepare for many exams and see different lecturers , which is confusing and the results are not as good as those of the ones from the one subject plan .  In addition , when one specializes in one subject then this person has more chances to be well-informed about it and do his best , being sure he recieves the best knowledge and invests in something substantial and prosperious .  The second reason is that this kind of studying gives the opportunity to work and gain your own money .  Usually students depend on their parents and have to explain why they need money , which is not very pleasant .  For instance , I used to work when i did not have many lessons and I was happy that I was able to succeed in working and doing something important as an adult does , relying on my own experience .  The third reason is that the students can pay more attention to their relatives , friends and even their hobbies .  Moreover , life is not only studying and if we cannot enjoy it , we should rethink our point of view .  For example , students , who do not have fun and only study , get sick and miss the both chances .  The psychologies have proved that working hard is not the best for our health and we should take rest from time to time .   In my opinion , it is better to specialize in one subject , because this choice makes us have more healthy life , which has is successful too .

ZHO	P2	medium	Some people believe that young people can enjoy life more than older poeple do .  But from my point of view , the opposite is the truth .  I think it is hardly for a young man to enjoy his life better than an older man .   First of all , nowadays few young people are aware the purpose of their lives .  It is hard to say that a person could be happy without knowing the purpose of his life .  Instead , many of them idle their precious time .  They do not know what they should care most in their life .  Older people , on the contrary , know exactly what their purpose are .  So they do not care much over other trifles as young people do .  They know how to set up a goal and keep chasing it .  This is what I envy older people most .  One of my cousins spent two years in a colleage and try to find her favorite major .  But even now she cannot make up her mind because she change her interest so frequently .   Furthermore , young people are not mature enough to control themselves .  So they make more mistakes .  Many young people do things just out of an impluse , .  Sometimes it can be dangerous to do things this way .  As for older people , most of them know clearly what is right and what is wrong .  They have their own judgements and they can often do things according to their life experiences .  No wonder our young people always need an adult to teach us right from wrong .   Finally , young people are much easier to give in to temptations , especially in today 's society .  They are not steady enough to avoid the bad effects of many negative things in our society .  But as for older people , they have seen much more than us , so they know when and how to say no to temptations .   So , I think it is easier for an older person to enjoy his life than a young person .  But I also believe we young people need guides and we learn how to live and enjoy our lives through mistakes and experiences .  As we grow older , we will enjoy our lives better .*
